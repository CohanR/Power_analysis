# Power_analysis
Using effects sizes of a study and performing power analysis 

For between-subjects designs, Cohen's d is often calculated directly from the differences in means between groups and the pooled standard deviations. However, the study I am using does not provide direct mean and standard deviation values for GABA and glutamate levels, but rather correlation coefficients and partial eta squared (ηp²) for the effect of GABA and glutamate. I can convert ηp² to Cohen's d for use in an independent samples t-test power analysis. This conversion is not straightforward for correlation coefficients (Rs, rho) without additional information on means and standard deviations.
